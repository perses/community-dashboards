# Perses Community Mixins

Welcome to the **Perses Community Mixins** repository! This project is designed to provide Prometheus mixins tailored for the Perses platform. Developed with the **Perses Go SDK**, these dashboards are modular, reusable, and simple to integrate into various observability setups.

This repo also offers Prometheus Operator format recording rules and alerts alongside these dashboards, also maintained in Go as a complete mixin solution!

> **Note:** These dashboards are compatible with Perses version 0.52.0 and onwards.

## Library Panels

In addition to the Community Mixins, this repository also offers a **library of reusable panels**. These panels can be used as building blocks for custom dashboard creation, enabling you to craft tailored setups to suit specific observability needs.

## Rendering Dashboards

To render and generate the dashboards, run the following command:

```bash
make build-dashboards
```

The generated dashboard files will be stored as **YAML files** in the `examples/dashboards/` directory by default and split by component (both in native Perses and Perses Operator format). You can then import these files into your Perses instances.

## Rendering PrometheusRules

To render and generate the PrometheusRule objects, run the following command:

```bash
make build-rules
```

## Local Development Guide

For local development, you can quickly spin up a Perses environment with the following command:

```bash
make start-demo
```

This command initializes a local Perses instance that includes predefined resources such as Projects and DataSources. Once the instance is running, you can access the Perses UI at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

### Applying Dashboards with `percli`

You can use `percli` to apply the dashboards to your Perses instance. Use the [percli](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/perses/perses/cmd/percli) tool with the following commands:

```bash
# Connect to your perses instance, for example if you want to use the demo perses
percli login http://localhost:8080/

# Add the dashboards to your instance (component-wise)
percli apply -d examples/dashboards/perses/prometheus/

# Add all the dashboards to your instance
find ./examples/dashboards/perses -type d -mindepth 1 -exec percli apply -d {} \;
```

This will deploy the dashboards from the `examples/dashboards/perses` directory to your local Perses instance.

### Applying Dashboards with Perses Operator

Once you have installed Perses Operator, with a `Perses` instance and `PersesDatasource` object in your cluster (following the instructions [here](https://github.com/perses/perses-operator?tab=readme-ov-file#running-on-the-cluster)), you can apply the generated `PersesDashboard` objects using:

```bash
# Add the dashboard CRDs to Perses (component-wise)
kubectl apply -f examples/dashboards/operator/kubernetes/

# Add all the dashboard CRDs to Perses
kubectl apply -f examples/dashboards/operator/ -R
```
